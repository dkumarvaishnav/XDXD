Creating each of these data visualization projects can be a great way for beginners to learn and practice data visualization in Python. Let's go through a step-by-step guide for each project:

**1) Scatter Plot with Matplotlib:**
- Choose a dataset with two numerical variables (e.g., height vs. weight or age vs. income).
- Import the necessary libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Pandas).
- Load the dataset using Pandas.
- Use Matplotlib to create a scatter plot using the two numerical variables from the dataset.
- Customize the plot with labels, title, and color.

**2) Horizontal Bar Chart using Pandas:**
- Select a dataset with categorical variables and their corresponding values (e.g., top programming languages and their popularity).
- Import the necessary libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib).
- Load the dataset using Pandas.
- Use Pandas to sort the data in descending order.
- Create a horizontal bar chart using Matplotlib or the built-in plotting functions in Pandas.
- Customize the plot with labels and title.

**3) Boxplot with Seaborn:**
- Find a dataset with multiple numerical variables (e.g., exam scores of students in different subjects).
- Import the necessary libraries (e.g., Seaborn).
- Load the dataset using Pandas.
- Use Seaborn to create a boxplot to visualize the distribution of each numerical variable.
- Customize the plot with labels and title.

**4) Histogram with Plotnine (ggplot):**
- Choose a dataset with a numerical variable (e.g., age distribution of a population).
- Import the necessary libraries (e.g., Plotnine, Pandas).
- Load the dataset using Pandas.
- Use Plotnine (a Python implementation of ggplot2) to create a histogram of the numerical variable.
- Customize the plot with labels and title.

**5) Stacked Bar Plot:**
- Select a dataset with categorical variables and numerical values for each category (e.g., sales data for different products in different regions).
- Import the necessary libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib).
- Load the dataset using Pandas.
- Group and aggregate the data to obtain the sums for each category.
- Use Matplotlib to create a stacked bar plot showing the contributions of each category.
- Customize the plot with labels and title.

Remember to install the required libraries using pip if you haven't already. For example, you can install matplotlib using:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

It's essential to have some basic knowledge of Python and data manipulation libraries like Pandas before attempting these projects. As you progress through each project, you'll gain a better understanding of data visualization concepts and improve your Python skills. Happy coding!
